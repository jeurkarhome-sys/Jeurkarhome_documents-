That's a great request! To create simple, direct, one-to-one bullet points, I will distill the core activity into a clear, actionable statement, focusing on the main AWS service or skill involved.

Here are the simplified, one-to-one bullet points based on the common AWS Admin daily activities:

## ✨ Simple, Direct AWS Admin Bullet Points

* **Managed** and provisioned core compute resources, including **EC2** instances and **Auto Scaling Groups**.
* **Monitored** system health, performance metrics, and application logs using **CloudWatch**.
* **Ensured** system stability and high availability by maintaining **Elastic Load Balancers (ALB/NLB)**.
* **Implemented** and maintained infrastructure using **CloudFormation** or **Terraform (IaC)**.
* **Secured** resource access and defined user permissions using **IAM roles and policies**.
* **Configured** and audited network security rules via **Security Groups** and **Network ACLs**.
* **Managed** and secured data storage solutions, primarily **S3** and **EBS**.
* **Executed** regular operating system (OS) patching and updates using **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**.
* **Optimized** cloud spending through resource **Rightsizing** and cost analysis using **Cost Explorer**.

These bullets are easy to read and clearly showcase the breadth of your skills across key AWS domains.

Would you like me to expand any of these bullets into a more detailed, accomplishment-focused statement (e.g., adding metrics like cost reduction or uptime)?
